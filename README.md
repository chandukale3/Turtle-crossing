## 🎮 Game Rules

* The **turtle starts at the bottom** of the screen and your goal is to reach the **top**.
* Use the **Up Arrow** key to move the turtle **forward**.
* **You can’t move backward** — only forward!
* **Cars** move horizontally across the screen — avoid them at all costs.
* Every time you reach the top, your **level increases** and the **car speed increases** too.
* **If the turtle gets hit by a car, it's game over**!
